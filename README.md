- 👋 Hi, I’m @HaaZtyleTech

- 👀 I’m interested in networking, data management, enterprise gear, network security and self-hosting services.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning home networking, cisco networking, and attempting some scripting for automation of security of my networking gear in the home. 

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on- I currently do not have the skills for any coding collaboration. I was a hardware guy and gamer for years and made a 
      number of custom water cooled systems in the interest in cooling parts as cold as they can go when OCing back in the day when de-lidding was a thing.

- 📫 How to reach me HaaZtyleTech.com@gmail.com

- Goals- I am currently a disabled Veteran and I do this as a way to keep busy as it has always interested me. With my difficulty to get out of the house 
    and work normal hours the end game would be to find a job where I can work from home maybe instead of being just on VA benifits.

-I'm just making a log of any scripts and or programs I write as a record for off site redundancy.
